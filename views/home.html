        <h2>Components availability</h2>
        <p>Please consult <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a> for availability of components.</p>

        <h3>ffplay</h3>
        <p>For example to use ffplay on Linux you'll have to stick to version 3.2 and even then it's available only for x86 and x86-64 platforms.</p>

        <h3>ffserver</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/index.html#ffserv">ffserver has been deprecated</a>
          and removed by the FFmpeg team in version 4.0.
        </p>

        <h3>Want to help?</h3>
        <p>I will be looking into compiling the binaries myself in the long term to provide full coverage of components as well as versions with and without proprietary codecs.</p>
        <p>Get in touch via this <a href="https://github.com/ffbinaries/ffbinaries-prebuilt" target="_blank">repo's issues or pull requests</a> if you'd like to help.</p>
