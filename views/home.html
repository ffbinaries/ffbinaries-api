    <h2>Components availability</h2>
    <p>Please consult <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a> for availability of components.</p>
    <p>For example to use ffplay on Linux you'll have to stick to version 3.2 and even then it's available only for x86 and x86-64 platforms.</p>
    <p>I will be looking into compiling the binaries myself in the long term to provide full coverage of components as well as versions with and without proprietary codecs.</p>
    <p>Get in touch via this <a href="https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-prebuilt" target="_blank">repo's issues or pull requests</a> if you'd like to help.</p>

    <h2>Help</h2>
    <p>If you'd like to help I'm looking for someone to write custom scripts to allow compilation of ffmpeg
    at each release version (starting with 3.x series). Raise an issue in ffbinaries-prebuilt repo to get in touch.</p>
